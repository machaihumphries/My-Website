<h1>I'm Machai Humphries, I'm 13 years old going to turn 14 this year on August 18. I'm African American white, standing at 5'9'' with how ever many pounds I am. I just got promoted to high school 9th grade, I went to longfellow middle school and now I am going to Berkeley high school. I was born in Oakland California and have moved to many places in my lifetime. I like things like drawing and creating my own pictures and things like that. I also like making comic books, my own characters and even fan creations of stuff like books or videogames. Speaking of videogames I also like them too, usually things related to Nintendo. Mario, The legend of Zelda, Pok√©mon and things like that. Nintendo and the author Dave Pilkey inspired me to make much more creative and unique things. For stories and comic based to videogame ideas I had. One idea I had for a videogame is a type of puzzle game based on fridge magnets that are shaped like stick figures, the goal of the game is to get 3 main stick figure magents to the goal, using their magnetic abilities to climb on matalic objects to work together. Another idea I had for a game is a stratege based game where you have to manage your land as a leader, later on when you get more expireance you can take over the whole world, and then after that other planets, how you do that is by using limited amount of money you have and make more of it by building new territories and taking over exsisting ones owned by CPU's or other players online. The idea is kind of half baked but think of it as a wider scale of clash of clans. I have many ideas and to be honest I'd wnt to be more of a game designer than coding one. But as taking this program it makes me more and more want to be a coder.</h1>
