		<p>Today I learned about the main community norms about this program. There are simple rules like be respectful and treat others the way you’d want to be treated; but there are super serious rules that MUST(capital MUST BTW) be followed under no circumstances. Like no making others ears bleed, A.K.A. no playing kids bop or country rap!</p>

		<p>"Topic Of The Day" Link Juneteenth is a important day in the year because it celebrates when african americans were free from slavery in the year 1895 on June 19 but wasn't figured out until 2 years later because some people who didn’t want slavery to go away so they didn’t tell any of their slaves. It’s important to celebrate this day because even today there is still racism around black people and other races too. History of Juneteenth - JUNETEENTH WORLD WIDE CELEBRATION

“A People without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots.” - Marcus Garvey

    	<h1> Solving Problems with my Brothers</h1>
		<p>

“We must learn to live together as brothers or we will perish together as fools” -  Dr. Martin Luther King
This quote is simple and to the point, it’s saying if we don’t work together than we will fail. Working together is what brought the human race together, how we got here today. We can help eachother out by teaching stuff we missed, or just giving the answers completely.

    	<h1> “It is better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have one than to have an opportunity and not be prepared.” - Whitney M. Young
“If you stay ready, you won’t have to get ready” - Will Smith</h1>
		<p>


These two quotes have something in common on the same subject, and it’s being prepared for anything. Being prepared is pretty important, if people were prepared all the time then to be honest the world would’ve been way more easy and simple. But it wouldn’t be the  world we live in today. Instead of studying for a test you could’ve just been prepared for the test from the start.

    	<h1> SOCIAL CONSTRUCT</h1>
		<p>


“If you make a man feel that he is inferior, you do not have to compel him to accept an inferior statues, for he will seek it himself. If you make a man think that he is justly an outcast, you do not have to order him to the back door. He will go without being told, and if there is no back door, his very nature will demand one.” - Carter G. Woodson

This quote is basically saying that don’t expect anyone to feel bad after you insult them or purposely make them feel bad. If you boost their confidence then they feel good, and they’ll go threw the front door instead. It’s also a way of hypnotism surprisingly, if you tell someone to do something if your a boss or something that’s literally a way of hypnotism.
