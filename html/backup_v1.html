	<p>"Topic Of The Day" Link Juneteenth is a important day in the year because it celebrates when african americans were free from slavery in the year 1895 on June 19 but wasn't figured out until 2 years later because some people who didn’t want slavery to go away so they didn’t tell any of their slaves. It’s important to celebrate this day because even today there is still racism around black people and other races too. </P>

“Time is more valuable than money. You can get more money, but you cannot get more time.” - Jim Rohn
These two quotes relate to each other. It’s about time and how the future rest in our hands. To make the future bigger and brighter than now, times are always changing so it’s important to keep up with it.  And that we always need to stay sharp and always be wary about what’s coming next, time is unpredictable so it's really important that we are always ready." </p><br>

We as people are all different, we don’t have to live the same way as our friends or family lives, it’s your own destiny and you should do whatever you want with it.

	<p>"Respect

Respecting others is the key to getting respect yourself.

This quote really explains a lot and basically saying that if you want respect you have to give respect. This has rule has been around for ages, but it’s harder for a black person to gain respect by giving respect. But if we work hard we’ll get great benefits out of it. Like for example… Respect!"</p>

Quote of the day
“If we as a people realized the greatness from which we came, we would be less likely to disrespect ourselves.” -Marcus Garvey
I think what this quote is saying is that if we took time to understand our beginnings we would be better and stronger as a team. Working with new people is tough because you don’t know how they work and how they function. If we took the time to know each other then we’d be able to get along better and work better as a team. </p>

If you make a man think that he is justly an outcast, you do not have to order him to the back door. He will go without being told, and if there is no back door, his very nature will demand one.” - Carter G. Woodson

This quote is basically saying that don’t expect anyone to feel bad after you insult them or purposely make them feel bad. If you boost their confidence then they feel good, and they’ll go threw the front door instead. It’s also a way of hypnotism surprisingly, if you tell someone to do something if your a boss or something that’s literally a way of hypnotism.

	<p>  Solving problems is important to life, it makes it easier to live and not have that much inconveniences and helps us grow as a community.

“Only a wise person can solve a difficult problem” - Akan proverb
This quote raises many questions, like why can only wise people solve difficult problems, or what kind of problems, what does wise even mean? Well all these questions will be answered including what this quote even means.
According to the internet wise means, “having or showing experience, knowledge, and good judgment.” </p>

	<p> Habits can be  good thing or a bad thing, it all depends on how we use it.

“We are what we repeatedly do excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit” - Aristotle

You get good at something you do constantly. If you do it everyday and enjoy it you’d most likely do it a lot and everyday. You get better at it every time you do it. And with encouragement from family and peers you’d end up doing it so much that you can’ help but do it again.

	<font>Quote of the day

I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and to incur my own abhorrence.
Frederick Douglass
Be yourself, don’t let someone else choose your destiny. You wouldn't feel yourself if your always following other people 

Topic of the day
How to respect yourself


Respect yourself
Know who you are
Discover you principals
Nobody can tell you who you really are
Start getting your mindset together

Age doesn't matter when dealing with respect. Give people respect if they give you respect. Parents are a good example of not giving respect but expect respect to them. They mainly think this because they are superior in age and have more experience on this planet. I feel like if an adult gives more respect to their child then they would easier to take care of, of course the child would have to get respect as well. </font>   <br>

	<font>“The most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed.” - Bantu Stephen Biko

What this quote is trying to say is that if the oppressor (for example like a torturer or someone cruel.) gets control over your mind and the way you think that’s the true weapon. No gun, sword or anything like that can compare to someone getting control over your mind. There’s 5 faces of oppression: Violence, exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, and cultural imperialism.
Violence in oppression meaning things like predijisnus, like a black man getting beat by racist cops, or gay people getting harassed for their sexual orientation, or a woman in the army getting shunned upon for being a woman.
Exploitation meaning treating someone unfairly for your benefit, like stealing their work and claiming it as their own.
Marginalization is treating anyone with disrespect that is lower than you. Anyone, any group, or idea.
Powerlessness is a lack of power against someone that is more powerful.  Anyone can be powerful but it’s the mind that precepts what is powerful or not. For example slavery, slave owners in order to get control of their slaves they beat them, yelled at them, and practically hypnotized them to think africans were lower than the white man. They made them think they are worthless and that them as people were prophesied to be slaves and nothing else.
Culterl imperialism is basically just being predigest…. That’s about it.

	<font>Relationship Between The Black Man And Black Woman

1. The most disrespected person in America is the black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the black woman. The most neglected person in America is the black women.
2. The black man will never get anybody's respect until he first learn to respect his own women

	<font>A good leader can surpass many things, even if it seems impossible it can still be done.
“An army of sheep led by a lion can defeat an army of lions led by a sheep.” - African Proverb
This quote is basically saying with a good leader, anything is possible thru the power of teamwork anything is possible. The point of a leader is for them to be knowledgeable in leading their team to their goal they want to achieve. It takes the leader and their followers to work together for all of them to gain victory. Of course with a good leader, a good team would have to be present too.
