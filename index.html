<p>Creativity is something everbody has, but there's not many places where the can express it the way they want to, so I want to create a website that people around the world can express themselves in many different ways. What I want to acheive and help people with is becoming more creative and diverse with creating entertainment like stories, movies and more! Most media these days to me are really similer to eachother with only a mostly a few things having creative techniques and things added in to be brand new and fresh. I want to create a website where people can express all sorts of creative things, from art, videos, stories, comics, poems, ideas, games, to even fan art and supporting franchises. Now with all these subjects it would be hard keeping track of ALL of them, so I thought of spliting all these different subjects into sections, so they can be easy to navigate and travel threw. This website will also track what kind of things you look at constantly or just like and use that information to mostly show things you like. This feature can always be turned off with the settings if you don't want it. I'm hoping this website would bring together a lot of people to and form a good, healthy and fun community.</p>font> </p>

<p> The hidden genius project is a program that my parents found out about before summer started. To be honest I was a little disapointed that I was going to spend my summer on this program that I was not totally intrested in. But once I started looking more into it the program looked intresting and actually really fun. Once I got there everyone wasn't so comfortable with eachother but within days it felt like we knew eachother for years. This year was pretty tough for me because I wasn't really expecting what we were going to do. It was tough but I'm sure for my second year I'll be more prepared for what's coming for me. In the hidden genius project we do things called mindfullness, where basically we talk about certain topics like what recently happened in the world, what happened in the past, and just certian topics that are important to talk about. Everyday when we do these the topics are so intresting to know about and discuss. the hidden genius mentors even let us get into the topic and share our feelings and ideas for it. And even after the whole discussion and we have break brotha's still have something to say and discuss about it with their peers, it gets really intresting and heated. And speaking of break during lunch breaks the lunches are gourmet; and no not any fancy resturant foods, I'm talking bout the best kind of food, Panda Express, Wing Stop, Dominoes etc. never have a ever seen someone complain about it.      </p>
